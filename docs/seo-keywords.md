SEO Keyword Research — Seed List (Nepal-focused)

Overview
- Goal: Provide a prioritized seed keyword set focused on trekking in Nepal for the MVP (trek list, trek detail, compare, inquiry). These keywords are organized by intent and suggested landing pages to ensure coverage across discovery → evaluation → conversion stages.
- Scope: Nepal-only for now, with both short-tail and long-tail queries useful for content pages, blog posts, and product/offers.

Files added
- `docs/seo-keywords.csv` — CSV with seed keywords, intent (informational/commercial/transactional), priority (high/medium/low), suggested page mapping, suggested title and short note.
- `docs/seo-keywords.md` — this explanatory note and next steps.

How to expand this seed list
1. Run each seed through Ahrefs / Semrush / Google Keyword Planner to capture: search volume, KD/competition, CPC, and parent topic clusters.
2. Use AlsoAsked and People Also Ask to find related question-style queries and FAQ items.
3. Group keywords into clusters (pillar + supporting articles). Example cluster: "Everest Base Camp" (pillar: EBC overview; supporting: cost, itinerary, packing, permits, flights to Lukla).
4. Prioritize pages to build based on traffic potential + conversion intent (start with high commercial and high informational core pages).

Suggested immediate tasks (quick wins)
- Add per-page primary keyword and 2–3 secondary keywords to page templates (Home, Trek List, Trek Detail, Compare).
- Create or enrich the permit reference page and safety guide (high intent informational pages).
- Build internal links from trek list & detail pages to permit, safety, packing, and logistics articles.
- Create a short blog series around "cost" and "seasonality" queries to capture high-intent informational traffic.

On-page optimization checklist for each target page
- Title tag includes primary keyword (50–60 chars).
- Meta description includes a value proposition and secondary keywords (120–160 chars).
- H1 includes the primary keyword.
- URL slug is short and contains the keyword (e.g., `/treks/everest-base-camp`).
- Schema: Add JSON-LD for Breadcrumbs and FAQ schema where applicable.
- OG tags: custom OG image and description for social sharing.

Next steps I can take for you
- Run automated keyword expansion using Ahrefs/Semrush (requires API or account).
- Build content outlines for top 10 target pages (titles, H2s, FAQ suggestions, internal links).
- Add meta and OG templates to Next.js components and generate per-trek meta from the dataset.

If you want me to proceed now, tell me which subtask: "expand keywords with data (needs external tools)", "create content outlines for top pages", or "add meta/OG per-trek templates".
