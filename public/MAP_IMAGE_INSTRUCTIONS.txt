NEPAL MAP IMAGE SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
====================================

To use your custom medieval/fantasy Nepal map image:

1. Save your Nepal map image (the one from the reference) as: nepal-map.png
2. Place it in this folder: public/nepal-map.png
3. The image should show Nepal's geography with mountains, terrain, and borders

Image Requirements:
- Format: PNG (preferred) or JPG
- Recommended size: 2000-4000px wide for good quality
- The image will be stretched to fit Nepal's geographical bounds:
  - West: 79.5° longitude
  - East: 88.5° longitude  
  - North: 30.5° latitude
  - South: 26.0° latitude

The flags/markers will be positioned on top of this image based on trek coordinates.

Alternative: If you want to use a different filename, update this line in:
src/components/trek/interactive-nepal-map.tsx (around line 95)

Change:
  url: '/nepal-map.png'
To:
  url: '/your-image-name.png'
